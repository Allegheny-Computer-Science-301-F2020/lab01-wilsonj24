### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 - AI and the future of privacy.

-  Reference or article citation.
 - https://towardsdatascience.com/ai-and-the-future-of-privacy-3d5f6552a7c4

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - This article talks about the correlation of how the data that is obtained through
 Artificial Intelligence can undermine what most people believe to be a basic human
 right which is privacy. The problem that arises here is that data mining and the advancement
 of our technology has made privacy such a big issue in the recent decade.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The ethical concern here is the idea of people's privacy is being exploited because
 of the capabilities that AI bring to the table. From the article, AI has the ability to
 gather, analyze and and combine vast quantities of data from different sources. This is
 an ethical concern because now, AI can take data from things we use everyday such as
 cellphones and laptops.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data that is being manipulated in the article is the data that is being collected
 from our cellphones and the web browsers that we are using. Things like voice recognition
 and face recognition are being used to track people without probable cause or reason of
 suspicion.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - The data that is being analyzed in the article is the data that is being collected from
 users and certain companies or organizations are using this data to track people
 without their consent. The way they are analyzing this data is by tracking what
 people are doing everyday, understanding who they are being in contact with, and
 understanding their habits and patterns and then can "predict" what people may do, go
 or who they will interact with.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The users of certain cellphones and web browsers are losing their privacy from
 this form of analysis. Government agencies can track and observe people without them
 knowing or their consent which is a huge issue. This is a huge invasion of privacy and this
 ties back into what the author was talking about at the beginning of the article about how
 privacy should be a basic human right that everyone deserves.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
 - The ugly truth: tech companies are tracking and misusing our data, and thereâ€™s little we can do

-  Reference or article citation.
 - https://theconversation.com/the-ugly-truth-tech-companies-are-tracking-and-misusing-our-data-and-theres-little-we-can-do-127444

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - What this article is talking about is how major tech companies and industries are
 misusing and collecting our data and the end users can't really do too much to stop
 this (unless we just don't use their product). In the article it explains that major
 tech companies such as Amazon and Apple have reported that they are using human annotators
 to listen to personal converations recorded from virtual assistants such as siri and alexa.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The ethical concern here is again privacy. Instead though, we have put our trust in
 these companies because we believed that they would take our privacy seriously, instead
 it seems like they are exploiting our data.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data that is being manipulated in the article is the data that we are willingly
 giving to tech companies and organizations that we felt comfortable giving our information to
 unfortunately, this is not the case as there are many tech companies to have known to
 have many privacy issues when it comes to using their products or services

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - The way these companies are analyzing our data is by "tricking" us into thinking
 that if we put our information into their website that it will be safe, secure and protected.
 The unfortunate thing about this is that we as end users are voluntarily giving our
 information to these tech companies.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The end users stand to lose as not only is our privacy being invaded but ultimately,
 users will start losing trust in tech companies which would be a shame because a lot
 of them do have great products that can be beneficial to the public. The tech companies gain
 insight to who their customers are and could start doing this like showing them advertisements
 of products that they tend to seem and like.
